# Phase 2: Narowing down the Application

## Task Finalization

As we are moving towards advancements where every thing is advanced. I intent to implement an application or provide ease to the society by applying HCI concepts to that task are:
- Teacher activites
- Student activities


## Need Finding

How can Student study at Home? 

First, Government should provide free shipping service. They need to work with every school (Public or Private). Then the duty of each school is to pack each student textbook and confirmed the mailing address for each student. And then delivered them through any courier company (TCS) to each student one by one. Meanwhile, some schools offer free electronic textbooks for students to download. 

We know that there are so many disadvantages, such as “no interaction”. But we have to consider the fact that in Pakistan, not each family has a computer for study, but each family has a TV. And in fact, after 2 months studying, lots of families preferred their children to study by TV, because its screen is so big that parents don't need to worry about eyesight, and because the TVs are usually in the living room, so parents can watch their kid's study. 

Second, students can study at home through the following ways: 
Cable TV, Mobile Phone, Computer/PC 

It can be used for Junior school students (I, II, III).  As for the Middle and Senior school students, there are more complex platforms such as, WhatsApp, Google classroom, Edmodo, Zoom, etc.  
More importantly, teachers can distribute homework and correct papers on the platform and can also do online tests on it. 
We have practiced online study for nearly five months now. Although there are so many difficulties, but still teachers are trying their best to ensure that each student receives their right to education. 


Who are the major target? 

Major targets are Teachers and Students. 


## Design Alternatives
I have created design by looking on a similar applications and current trends. How they can help user to accomplish their tasks, what more can we add in our design to gain more user attention and providing with friendly environment.

## Manage activities

### Design Alternative 1:
In this design alternative, the complete focus is on activites interface. At the beginning, some of the buttons will be presented which will provide some of the interface where user can perfom task by just clicking on a button. The buttons will display different categories like create task, take quiz, upload lecture, manage students, start lecture etc. Where user can categorize their tasks accordingly. When user press a button it will move to another interface. And user’s picture will be shown at the top right. By clicking on a picture, user can take or upload his picture.  


### Design Alternative 2:
This design alternate will show the tasks on the screen that needs to be done for that specific day or week. Current page will display the task that needs to be submitted while, the bottom of the screen will show past activities that is tasks that the user had already been submitted. In this past activities column, the tasks that are shown will be marked with successful submission or missing a file. Once the task is completed and submitted by the user it will be marked with green tag that this task is submitted succesfully while on the other the task that user failed to perform will be marked with red indicating the missing file. User can also resubmit a task. 


### Design Alternative 3:
In this design, the focus is that user can handle an interface easily. User can check the calender whenever he wants. And below that user will be able to see his schedule for recent meetings that he has already been added. Furthermore, there will be colorful dot according to the number of task below the specific meetings, so, he will be able to see at what date he has a meeting. To move calendar dates there will arrow left and right. If user want to add a meeting, he has to first click on the date and then Plus(+) sign to add the new schedule where another page will be appear where user can set time and gives detail of a meeting and open the notify option that will notify the user 30 min before the given timing. User can also update the schedule by clicking on the schedule and he can also delete it.


### Design Alternative 4:
This design alternative provides user an interface that will show them the uploaded lectures at the bootom of the interface. On the top of the interface, it will provide an option to upload a lecture. It will also mention the date corresponding to the each lecture. User can also delete a lecture.


## Manage class

### Design Alternative 5:
In this design we have simply focuses on scheduling interface. At the beginning, user can see todays date and the recent schedule of the day and user can also see a pointer which will point meeting time as well as which time meeting has been past. There will also be a icon for calendar to show. Where user will be able to see other schedule by clicking on the specific date. The date will be bold where he has a meeting schedule. To move calendar dates there will arrow left and right. There will be a plus(+) sign to add a task. User have to first click on the date and then Plus(+) sign to add the new meeting where another page will be appear where user can set time and gives detail of meeting. As well as user can update the meeting by clicking on the meeting and he can also delete it.


### Design Alternative 6:
In this design we have focus on the easy to handle interface by user. User can see today’s date and the calendar in weekly base, and at calendar todays date will be highlighted with another color. And below that user will be able to see his schedule for today date that he has already added and schedule according to recent time will be highlighted by another color and it will be bold. Furthermore, he will also be able to see other schedule by clicking on the specific date. There will be star according to the number of meeting average that tells that he has a busy day or normal or what it will be deal with 5 stars below the specific date, so, he will be able to see at what date he has a meeting and what date he has a busy schedule. To move calendar dates there will arrow left and right. There will be a plus (+) sign to add a meeting. User have to first click on the date and then Plus (+) sign to add the new schedule where another page will be appear where user can set time and gives detail of meeting and open the notify option and set time to notify at what time like 5 min before 10 min etc. As well as user can update the schedule by clicking on the icon edit to the schedule and he can also delete it. By clicking on the schedule he will be able to see the full detail of that meeting.

### Design Alternative 7:
This design alternative focuses on scheduling an interface. User can see today’s date and the calendar in weekly base, and the picture will be shown at the top right and at the calendar todays date will be highlighted with circle and below it there will be a dot. And below that user will be able to see his schedule for today date that he has already added a meeting. Furthermore, he will also be able to see other schedule by clicking on the specific date. The date will be bold below the specific date, so, he will be able to see at what date he has a meeting. To move on calendar there will icon of calendar. There will be a plus (+) sign to add a meeting. User have to first click on the date and then Plus (+) sign to add the new schedule where another page will appear where user can set time and he can also change the date from there and gives detail of meeting and open the notify option and set time to notify at what time like 5 min before 10 min etc. As well as user can update and delete schedule by clicking on the three dot options where both option will be appear and user has to click to the specify option.

## Scenarios:

- Aqdas is trying to facilitate more productive discussion in her class. Students are required to annotate electronic copies of the weekly assigned readings. The prototype collects these, and merges them, enabling Aqdas to project and point to different versions on the 3 large displays in the teaching room, and start discussing why different students had highlighted or commented on different parts of the research paper. The next day Aqdas meets with the research team to review what happened when she tried out the prototype in class. They review the use log data, trying out different visualizations to help in understanding what worked well, what was awkward to use, or performed poorly, and why. Next, they work on how they can improve the design before the next class. 

- Lisa is trying her best to educate her students. But due to her low experience in IT she couldn’t educate her student well. She’s trying her best to visualize to help in understanding how to use or what worked well. 

- Midterms are on their way and Usman has repeatedly asked if he can have an extension on each of the tasks. Usman sends his teacher an email to once again ask for more time. None of his work has been substandard but he doesn't stick by the timelines set for all students. Even when given an extension, he barely turns in his work by those deadlines. It is obvious that Usman has some issues in completing and submitting his task. Either he does not understand the task, and he also has a difficulty in submitting the task.

He still fails the second major task even after he had tried to complete the assignment properly. His teacher realize that Hassaan just doesn't seem to have the skills in Computer.
