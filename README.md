# Phase 2: Narowing down the Application

## Task Finalization

The list of design that I intent to implement in my application or provide ease to the society by applying HCI concepts to that task are:
- Managing class
- Activity


## Need Finding

How can Student study at Home? 

First, Government should provide free shipping service. They need to work with every school (Public or Private). Then the duty of each school is to pack each student textbook and confirmed the mailing address for each student. And then delivered them through any courier company (TCS) to each student one by one. Meanwhile, some schools offer free electronic textbooks for students to download. 

We know that there are so many disadvantages, such as “no interaction”. But we have to consider the fact that in Pakistan, not each family has a computer for study, but each family has a TV. And in fact, after 2 months studying, lots of families preferred their children to study by TV, because its screen is so big that parents don't need to worry about eyesight, and because the TVs are usually in the living room, so parents can watch their kid's study. 

Second, students can study at home through the following ways: 
Cable TV, Mobile Phone, Computer/PC 

It can be used for Junior school students (I, II, III).  As for the Middle and Senior school students, there are more complex platforms such as, WhatsApp, Google classroom, Edmodo, Zoom, etc.  
More importantly, teachers can distribute homework and correct papers on the platform and can also do online tests on it. 
We have practiced online study for nearly five months now. Although there are so many difficulties, but still teachers are trying their best to ensure that each student receives their right to education. 


Who are the major target? 

Major targets are Teachers and Students. 


## Design Alternatives

1) List down at-least 10 design alternatives.
### Design Alternative 1:
This design alternative will provide user with an interface in which user can show their screen to other users by just clicking a button. It will also show some options where users can chat easily or show some of their reactions. There will be an option with which user can talk to each other, or can ask queries.


### Design Alternative 2:
In this design alternative, the complete focus is on the interface in which user is going to perform a task performing in which user can create a new task by just clicking a "+" (plus) button. And there will be some options in which user can delete, save or update a task. Beside this, user can limit time and date. There is also an option where user can set some of the points.

### Design Alternative 3:
This deign alternative will provide user an interface where they can set a title or give instruction such as, user can specify the question, the correct answer, number of points for each question, and time limit to solve.

He has good sense of humor. He is ready to help everyone and shows his concern for students. He tries his best to come up with solutions in every difficult situation helping his fellow mates. 

 

 

### Student’s Persona: 

- Usman is 13 years old. He is in 8th class. His goal is to graduate school on time and stay healthy and active while in school. He’s facing challenges such as; submitting his task weekly, attending class. 

 

- Omaima is a student. She is undergraduate with the degree of BSCS. She is a talented and hardworking girl and also favorite among her teachers and contains good grades. She is passionate about her profession and working hard to achieve her goals. She is the most attentive student in class and submits her quiz and assignment on time. She has good sense of humor. She is ready to help everyone and shows her concern for class work. 

 

- There is a student name Hassaan. He is 11 years old. He is in 6th class. He is a hardworking boy and serious about his education. He has to work hard to achieve his goals. He is a talented. He loves to play. 


## Scenarios:

- Aqdas is trying to facilitate more productive discussion in her class. Students are required to annotate electronic copies of the weekly assigned readings. The prototype collects these, and merges them, enabling Aqdas to project and point to different versions on the 3 large displays in the teaching room, and start discussing why different students had highlighted or commented on different parts of the research paper. The next day Aqdas meets with the research team to review what happened when she tried out the prototype in class. They review the use log data, trying out different visualizations to help in understanding what worked well, what was awkward to use, or performed poorly, and why. Next, they work on how they can improve the design before the next class. 

- Lisa is trying her best to educate her students. But due to her low experience in IT she couldn’t educate her student well. She’s trying her best to visualize to help in understanding how to use or what worked well. 

- Midterms are on their way and Usman has repeatedly asked if he can have an extension on each of the tasks. Usman sends his teacher an email to once again ask for more time. None of his work has been substandard but he doesn't stick by the timelines set for all students. Even when given an extension, he barely turns in his work by those deadlines. It is obvious that Usman has some issues in completing and submitting his task. Either he does not understand the task, and he also has a difficulty in submitting the task. 

- Hassaan is an active student in his class and seems to be a hard worker. After failing the first major task in his class. He talks to his teacher about how he can improve. He still fails the second major task even after he had tried to complete the assignment properly. His teacher realize that Hassaan just doesn't seem to have the skills in Computer.
